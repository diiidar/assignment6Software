This implementation follows the facade design pattern by providing a simplified interface
to access the complex subsystems (BookInventorySystem and UserManagementSystem).
The facade (LibraryFacade) hides the details of these subsystems and provides methods for
common operations like adding books, searching for books, borrowing books, and returning books.

The Book class represents a book entity with attributes like title, author, and availability status.
The BookInventorySystem manages the collection of books, providing methods for adding books,
searching for books, borrowing books, and returning books. The UserManagementSystem manages library users.

The LibraryFacade class acts as a facade for both subsystems, providing a single interface for
interacting with the library management system. Users can perform operations like adding books,
searching for books, borrowing books, and returning books using the facade without worrying about
the underlying complexities of the subsystems.

The test class (LibraryManagementSystemTest) demonstrates how to use the facade to perform various
operations like adding books, searching for books, borrowing books, and returning books. It verifies
the functionality of the facade by checking the results of these operations.
